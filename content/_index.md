# Drupal Contribution Guideline (DCG)

This contribution guideline is designed to help all developers, from interns to tech leads, contribute to Drupal, the open-source content management system. Drupal welcomes contributions of all kinds, and we want to ensure that everyone can participate in the development process.

## Official Contribution Guidelines

## Finding Issues to Contribute

Before contributing to Drupal, you should first find an issue that you would like to work on. Drupal has a large community of contributors and users, and there are many ways to find issues that need to be addressed. Here are a few resources that you can use:

- [Drupal.org issue queue](https://www.drupal.org/project/issues): The Drupal.org issue queue is the primary location for tracking issues related to Drupal core and contributed modules. You can filter the issue queue to find issues that are suitable for your skill level or interests.

- [Drupal Slack](https://www.drupal.org/slack): The Drupal Slack community is a great place to connect with other Drupal contributors and ask for help finding issues or getting started with a contribution.

## Types of Issues to Pick

Drupal welcomes contributions of all kinds, from code to documentation to testing. Here are some types of issues that are suitable for different skill levels:

- Interns/Junior Developers: If you're new to Drupal or development in general, start by picking up some easy issues that have been identified as "Novice" or "Beginner" level issues. These might involve fixing typos, improving documentation, or adding simple features to a module.

- Senior Developers: If you have more experience with Drupal and development in general, consider picking up issues that are classified as "Intermediate" or "Advanced." These might involve more complex changes to Drupal core or contributed modules.

- Tech Leads: As a tech lead, you can contribute to Drupal by reviewing and testing patches submitted by other contributors. This is an important role in the Drupal community, as it helps ensure that patches are of high quality and meet the community's coding standards.

## Types of Issues to Avoid

There are some types of issues that you should avoid when contributing to Drupal. These include:

- Coding standard fixes: While fixing coding standards is important, these types of issues should not be the sole focus of a contribution. If you come across a coding standard issue while working on another issue, feel free to fix it, but do not create a new issue just to fix coding standards.

- Re-rolling patches: If a patch needs to be updated to work with a new version of Drupal or a contributed module, it is important to re-roll the patch. However, simply re-rolling a patch without making any other changes is not a meaningful contribution.

## Contributing to Drupal

Here are the steps to contribute to Drupal:

1. Choose an issue to work on.
2. Comment on the issue to let others know that you're working on it.
3. Fork the project.
4. Create a new branch for your changes.
5. Make your changes to the code or documentation.
6. Write tests to ensure that your changes are working correctly.
7. Commit your changes and push them to your fork.
8. Create a pull request with a descriptive title and detailed description of your changes.

## Conclusion

Contributing to Drupal is a great way to improve your skills, learn from other developers, and give back to the community. By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your contributions are of high quality and meet the needs of the community. If you have any questions or need help with your contribution, don't hesitate to ask
