## Finding Issues to Contribute

Before contributing to Drupal, you should first find an issue that you would like to work on. Drupal has a large community of contributors and users, and there are many ways to find issues that need to be addressed. Here are a few resources that you can use:

- [Drupal.org issue queue](https://www.drupal.org/project/issues): The Drupal.org issue queue is the primary location for tracking issues related to Drupal core and contributed modules. You can filter the issue queue to find issues that are suitable for your skill level or interests.

- [Drupal Slack](https://www.drupal.org/slack): The Drupal Slack community is a great place to connect with other Drupal contributors and ask for help finding issues or getting started with a contribution.

## DO'S AND DON'TS

### Types of Issues to Pick

Drupal welcomes contributions of all kinds, from code to documentation to testing. Here are some types of issues that are suitable for different skill levels:

- **Interns/Junior Developers:** If you're new to Drupal or development in general, start by picking up some easy issues that have been identified as "Novice" or "Beginner" level issues. These might involve fixing typos, improving documentation, or adding simple features to a module.

- **Senior Developers:** If you have more experience with Drupal and development in general, consider picking up issues that are classified as "Intermediate" or "Advanced." These might involve more complex changes to Drupal core or contributed modules.

- **Tech Leads:** As a tech lead, you can contribute to Drupal by reviewing and testing patches submitted by other contributors. This is an important role in the Drupal community, as it helps ensure that patches are of high quality and meet the community's coding standards.

### Types of Issues to Avoid

There are some types of issues that you should avoid when contributing to Drupal. These include:

- **Coding standard fixes:** While fixing coding standards is important, these types of issues should not be the sole focus of a contribution. If you come across a coding standard issue while working on another issue, feel free to fix it, but do not create a new issue just to fix coding standards.

- **Re-rolling patches:** If a patch needs to be updated to work with a new version of Drupal or a contributed module, it is important to re-roll the patch. However, simply re-rolling a patch without making any other changes is not a meaningful contribution.

- **Fixing typo or case sensitivity issues:** Typo or case sensitivity issues can be a common problem when working on Drupal. If you come across a typo or case sensitivity issue while working on another issue, You can ignore it or You can create the issue and tag it with _novice_ or _beginner_ and leave those issues for beginners who are new to Drupal. DON'T SPEND TIME FIXING TYPO OR CASE SENSITIVITY ISSUES.
